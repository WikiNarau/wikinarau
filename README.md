# WikiNarau

A free and open-source **wiki** for **learning material**, providing a platform for people to **create**, **share**, **teach** and **learn together**.

## Goals

We want to build a platform where you can create and take courses on any kind of subject matter, either by yourself, or in a group. All of this while upholding certain values we hold dear:

### Free

Requiring payment of any kind means that some people won't be able to get the education they want, we also believe that advertising of any kind is unethical in an educational setting.

### Open

We want to allow anyone to work together and improve both code and content, because of this the Code is licensed under a Copyleft license and all content on wikinarau.org is published under a Creative Commons license.

### Privacy conscious

A lot of services these days invade their users privacy for all kinds of reasons.  We want to provide a service that respects people's privacy, because of this we allow anyone to use WikiNarau without any sort of Login/E-Mail, we only collect the bare minimum of data required by law. We further want to encourage and support people to host their own WikiNarau instances.

## Status

While the software isn't particularly stable we try and keep things from breaking too much, if you want to see how it looks like [WikiNarau.org](https://wikinarau.org/) is probably the most Up to Date deployment.

## Contributing

If you share our goals and values, we'd love your help! Be it a pull-request, a great course, some artwork or just fixing a typo, we need your help to make this project great.
